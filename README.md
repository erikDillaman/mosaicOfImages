# mosaicOfImages
This sketch will load an image and compare its red, green, and blue values to an array of colorized, vintage photographs from Tsarist Russia, replacing the pixels of the original image with the photographs at a scale set by the user.  By clicking on any of the photo tiles, the original photograph will be displayed.
